Today is my first day working at PT. Nusa Digital Commerce, an e-commerce startup focused on MSME products in the Greater Malang area. I work as an application developer. After two days on the job, something seems strange about our application. Please help me figure out what's going on!

If you find a flag, don't input it right away, it needs something extra! Example: WRECKIT60{flag_Name_of_Vulnerability_1_Name_of_Vulnerability_2}
